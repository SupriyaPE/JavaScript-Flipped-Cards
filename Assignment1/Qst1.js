(`Java and JavaScript are completely different languages.
Java is a statically typed, object-oriented, compiled language used for building large applications like Android and enterprise systems.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed, interpreted scripting language mainly used to make web pages interactive and also used on the backend with Node.js.
They just share a similar name, but their purpose, syntax, and execution environments are totally different.`)

Syntax

Java
// class Demo {
//   public static void main(String[] args) {
//     System.out.println("Hello");
//   }
// }


JavaScript
console.log("Hello");
